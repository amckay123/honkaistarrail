The third story arc -also the second area you land on as an official member of the Astral Express- is called the Xianzhou Luofu. The people are
 immortal or have lived a seriously concerning amount of time, so they are reluctant to get help from you. The Express help them defeat a 
 huge foe- super epic boss fight fyi- and help save the Luofu. They give you a token that you can use to call them at any time if you need their help.
