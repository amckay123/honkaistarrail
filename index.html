This is a hit game by a company called Hoyoverse, more known for their other hit game, Genshin Impact.
Honkai: Star Rail follows the journey of the Astral Express from the perspective of the Trailblazer.
The Astral Express is a train that flies through space and lands at different planets that need help.
<br>
Here is two pictures of either Trailblazers you can choose.<br>

<br><br>
The first place you experience is the <a href="hertaspacestation.html">Herta Space Station</a>. The Trailblazer- aka you, player, etc- are an
artificial body, made to host something called a <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Stellaron" target="_blank">stellaron</a> which is a type of object that spreads 
around universes like a cancer, giving it the nickname "The Cancer of All Worlds". The Trailblazer wakes up to
two Astral Express members, Dan Heng and March 7th, trying to give you CPR. Please click <a href="hertaspacestation.html"> this link </a>to read
a short paragraph -with pictures- about the story arc of the Herta Space Station.
<br><br>
After you finish the Herta Space Station story, you go to the next planet called <a href="jarilovi.html"> Jarilo VI.</a>
Please click <a href="jarilovi.html">this link</a> or the link before to read a brief summary about the second story arc.
<br><br>
Once you finish the second story, you go to the next planet, the <a href="xianzhouluofu.html">Xianzhou Luofu</a>. If you would
like to learn more about the third story, please click <a href="xianzhouluofu.html">this link</a>.
<br><br>
There is a story 4 -in a place called Penacony- but I have not yet fully completed playing it- you can see what I do know <a href="penacony.html">here.</a>
