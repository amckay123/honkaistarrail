</h1>Honkai: Star Rail</h>
<br><br>
This is a hit game by a company called Hoyoverse, more known for their other hit game, Genshin Impact.
Honkai: Star Rail follows the journey of the Astral Express from the perspective of the Trailblazer.
The Astral Express is a train that flies through space and lands at different planets that need help.
<br><br>
The first place you experience is the Herta Space Station. The Trailblazer- aka you, player, etc- are an
artificial body, made to host something called a stellaron- which is a type of object that spreads 
around universes like a cancer, giving it the nickname "The Cancer of All Worlds". The Trailblazer wakes up to
two Astral Express members, Dan Heng and March 7th, trying to give you CPR. Please click this link to learn
more about the story arc of Herta Space Station.
<br><br>
After you finish the Herta Space Station story, you go to the next planet called the Xianzhou Luofu.
