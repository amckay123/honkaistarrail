    I haven't finished the Penacony story, so all of this is what I currently know. If you want to know more, click <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Penacony" target="_blank">here.</a>
    Beware of spoilers!!

    Penocony is the "Planet of Festivities". The Astral Express get an invite from The Family- a super important organization that pretty much runs Penacony- and you go
    and see what the heck is going on. Most of the story is spent in Penacony's Dreamscape- a vivid dream city of Penacony. Think of it like lucid dreaming
    in a place that looks exactly like Vancouver with your friends.

    Penacony used to be a prison run by the Interastral Peace Corporation -the IPC-, but when a stellaron appeared, the prisoners 
    revolted against the IPC and gained freedom.
